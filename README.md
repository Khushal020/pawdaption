# Pawdaption

Android application built using Kotlin, to allows shelters to list the stray dogs in the app.
So, people can see the pets in the list and adopt the pet from those shelter.

## Overview

The loyalty of dogs toward humans makes them our best friends. Stray dogs in many countries are neglected. There is no organization in these countries to take care of them. We are developing an app that enables humans to help dogs who are in grave danger and need a caring family. Our idea is to create an app that provides a centralized platform for connecting animal shelters and adopters. It will have an interface to connect registered users with veterinarians associated with a shelter. The app will also provide an interface for shelter users to add new pets and accept donations.
